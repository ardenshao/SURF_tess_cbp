# SURF_tess_cbp

This is a compilation of all the code I wrote for my SURF project on improving detections of circumbinary planets using the precession effect. Currently, it hosts useful methods for manually calculating a periodogram to determine the period for primary and secondary transits. The precession effect can also be observed to be quite dramatic in a following overlay/folded plot.
